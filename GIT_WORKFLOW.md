\## GitFlow vs GitHub Flow

GitFlow uses multiple long-lived branches like main and develop.

GitHub Flow is simpler and uses short-lived feature branches.



\## Rebase vs Merge

Rebase creates a linear history and is used for local branches.

Merge preserves full history and is safer for shared branches.
